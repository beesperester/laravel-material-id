##What is this all about?

When working on large scale cg projects or small personal designs it is easy to get lost in the amount of materials and their corresponding color coded ids.

You have your final comp setup, when suddenly you get renderings from a different software package and all your meticulously prepared material masks are useless.

With {{env('APP_NAME')}} you can convert your material names into unique and consistent material id colors with ease. Simply enter the name of your material and get the corresponding id color.           

By keeping your material names consistent across your software packages and projects you will get predictable and reproducible results for your color ids.

When using {{env('APP_NAME')}} it is easy to reuse comp setups because generic materials will always have the same color id.

When working with multiple assets in one scene, it is easy to create namespaces for asset specific materials by prefixing the material with a simple string e.g. spaceship-metal.
